# Stock Tracker Extension

Chrome extension that shows favourite stocks in a chrome extension icon. Select your favourite stocks and the extension will cycle between them every few seconds showing the current price. +/- is indicated by the text color.

Was made in a couple hours, code is pretty sloppy. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## My ticker name isn't being recognized

This extension uses the Yahoo Finance API for pulling stock information. Find the ticker name Yahoo Finance uses, which may be prefixed by the exchange. E.g. NYSE:SHOP
